Package: libtree-sitter-dev
Description-md5: bf3d6e6f9c3e81596198cc417600a9d0
Description-en: incremental parsing system for programming tools (development files)
 Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library. It
 can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the
 syntax tree as the source file is edited.
 .
 Tree-sitter aims to be:
 .
 * General enough to parse any programming language
 * Fast enough to parse on every keystroke in a text editor
 * Robust enough to provide useful results even in the presence of
 syntax errors
 * Dependency-free so that the runtime library (which is written in pure
 C) can be embedded in any application
 .
 This package contains the header files and libraries needed for developing
 with tree-sitter.

Package: neovim
Description-md5: cc27d693d853e57070e8edb4f6132d4c
Description-en: heavily refactored vim fork
 Neovim is a fork of Vim focused on modern code and features, rather than
 running in legacy environments.
 .
 msgpack API enables structured communication to/from any programming language.
 Remote plugins run as co-processes that communicate with Neovim safely and
 asynchronously.
 .
 GUIs (or TUIs) can easily embed Neovim or communicate via TCP sockets using
 the discoverable msgpack API.

Package: neovim-runtime
Description-md5: 04bdb26e78477e39ebd3562d0d7ee8f2
Description-en: heavily refactored vim fork (runtime files)
 Neovim is a fork of Vim focused on modern code and features, rather than
 running in legacy environments.
 .
 This package contains the architecture independent runtime files used by
 neovim.  Examples of such files are: documentation, rules for
 language-specific highlighting and indentation, color schemes, and standard
 plugins.
