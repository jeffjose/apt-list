Description-en: Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment - static binary
 AIDE is an intrusion detection system that detects changes to files on
 the local system. It creates a database from the regular expression rules
 that it finds from the config file. Once this database is initialized
 it can be used to verify the integrity of the files. It has several
 message digest algorithms (md5, sha1, rmd160, tiger, haval, etc.) that are
 used to check the integrity of the file. More algorithms can be added
 with relative ease. All of the usual file attributes can also be checked
 for inconsistencies.
 .
 This package contains the statically linked binary for "normal"
 systems.

Package: busybox-syslogd
Description-md5: 6d204aacbcadc9711030ab99f904ca3b
Description-en: Provides syslogd and klogd using busybox
 The system log daemon is responsible for providing logging of
 messages received from programs and facilities on the local host as
 well as from remote hosts.
 .
 The kernel log daemon listens to kernel message sources and is
 responsible for prioritizing and processing operating system
 messages.
 .
 The busybox implementation of the syslogd is particular useful on
 embedded, diskless (netboot) or flash disk based systems because it
 can use a fixed size ring buffer for logging instead of saving logs
 to the disk or sending it to remote logging servers. The ring buffer
 can be read using the (also busybox based) command logread.
 .
 This package provides the glue to the busybox syslogd and klogd to be
 used in the system by providing the appropriate symbolic links and
 scripts.

 For scanning to work, a virus database is needed. There are two options
 for getting it:
  - clamav-freshclam: updates the database from Internet. This is
    recommended with Internet access.

Package: uuid-dev
Description-md5: daeeb422c8be25af61a5fe52deff08a8
Description-en: Universally Unique ID library - headers and static libraries
 The libuuid library generates and parses 128-bit Universally Unique IDs
 (UUIDs). See RFC 4122 for more information.
 .
 This package contains the development environment for the uuid library.

Package: uuid-runtime
Description-md5: c848721d4a6e6dbc698c36d06bf45ef9
Description-en: runtime components for the Universally Unique ID library
 The libuuid library generates and parses 128-bit Universally Unique
 IDs (UUIDs). A UUID is an identifier that is unique within the space
 of all such identifiers across both space and time. It can be used for
 multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime
 to reliably identifying very persistent objects across a network.
 .
 See RFC 4122 for more information.
 .
 This package contains the uuidgen program and the uuidd daemon.
 .
 The uuidd daemon is used to generate UUIDs, especially time-based
 UUIDs, in a secure and guaranteed-unique fashion, even in the face of
 large numbers of threads trying to grab UUIDs running on different CPUs.
 It is used by libuuid as well as the uuidgen program.

 packages: vim, vim-nox, vim-athena, or vim-gtk3.

Package: winbind
Description-md5: 7716bdbd49ef007f51760bb859065b02
Description-en: service to resolve user and group information from Windows NT servers
 Samba is an implementation of the SMB/CIFS protocol for Unix systems,
 providing support for cross-platform file sharing with Microsoft Windows, OS X,
 and other Unix systems.  Samba can also function as a domain controller
 or member server in both NT4-style and Active Directory domains.
 .
 This package provides winbindd, a daemon which integrates authentication
 and directory service (user/group lookup) mechanisms from a Windows
 domain on a Linux system.
 .
 Winbind based user/group lookups via /etc/nsswitch.conf can be enabled via
 the libnss-winbind package. Winbind based Windows domain authentication can
 be enabled via the libpam-winbind package.

Package: winpr-utils
Description-md5: 5ad5407ece20a3e087a48f65ab4e7aec
Description-en: Windows Portable Runtime library command line utilities
 WinPR is a spin-off project of FreeRDP which aims at providing a portable
 implementation of important portions of the Windows API. Just like FreeRDP,
 WinPR is released under the Apache license. Unlike Wine, WinPR does not provide
 binary compatibility, and does not require applications to be built for
 Windows. Instead, WinPR provides API compatibility for applications targeting
 non-Windows environments. When on Windows, the original native API is being
 used instead of the equivalent WinPR implementation, without having to modify
 the code using it.
 .
 This package contains WinPR command line utils (winpr-hash, winpr-makecert).
